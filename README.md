      Welcome to my portfolio site!
      As you scroll down, sections animate smoothly into view â€” thanks to the AOS (Animate On Scroll) library.

These animations add polish and guide the viewerâ€™s attention section by section.

On certain parts of the site (e.g., hero section or project highlights), youâ€™ll notice interactive 3D elements powered by Spline, adding a futuristic and creative touch.

The rest of the flow remains intuitive: About â†’ Skills â†’ Projects â†’ Contact form.

Landing View: The homepage opens with a clean header that includes my name and a short tagline about what I do.

About Section: Here, I introduce myselfâ€”who I am, what Iâ€™m passionate about, and my background.

Skills Section: Next, youâ€™ll see my technical skills listed out clearly â€” from programming languages to tools I use daily.

Projects Section: This area showcases a few highlighted works, including descriptions and links to GitHub or live demos.

Contact Button: Clicking the contact link takes you to feedback.html, where visitors can send me a message via a form.

The site uses new.css for its visual styling and gradient.png to add subtle design flair. If added to a phone's home screen, itâ€™ll display a custom icon thanks to apple-touch-icon.png.
